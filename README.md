# MaxMinHeap

This project is Implementing and testing the data structure described as MaxMinHeap as one of the university tasks I was given during data structures and algorithms course.

MaxMinHeap specifications:
1. Each even depth node is greater than / equal to all of his descendants (Even == Max level)
2. Each even depth node is less than / equal to all of his descendants (Odd == Min level)
3. The class implements the next public methods:

- heapify (HEAPIFY)
- buildHeap (BUILD-HEAP)
- heapExtractMax (HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX)
- heapExtractMin (HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN)
- heapInsert (HEAP-INSERT)
- heapDelete (HEAP-DELETE)
